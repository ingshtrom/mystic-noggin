## RULES
- these scripts should be able to run completely alone, or with modules loaded by the app
  - under NO circumstances should modules be loaded specifically for these scripts
- running `node _index.js` should run all of the scripts in this directory
- any results or debugging should report to the console at the least.  If a script includes the logger... well then you are just shooting yourself in the foot by cluttering up the app's logs...
